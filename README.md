### 1. [BranchNet (MICRO 2020) Analysis](./BranchNet-Analysis/)
*   **Domain:** Branch Prediction, Deep Learning, Microarchitecture.
*   **Key Concept:** Using CNNs and Sum-Pooling to solve "Hard-to-Predict" branches caused by execution noise.
*   **My Contribution:** Proposed a "Dynamic Confidence-Based Hybrid Selector" to mitigate dataset shift risks in offline-trained models.
